# General Portal Demo
This project is a stripped down version of a project I've created for one of my customers. 
Due to the nature of the customer, the complete and functioning portal is private.

The purpose of this project is to serve as a bootstrap for future portals.

## Technologies used
I've built the portal with React and Redux. I've also integrated jqxWidgets for a table which you can see in
*/src/pages/administration/customers.js*

Everything is glued together with webpack 2.

For the UI I've opted for boostrap v4 and the react material UI library from http://www.material-ui.com
